# Mapping_Earthquakes
Javascript and APIs for mapping earthquake data

## Overview
This repository shows the most recent earthquakes from the past seven days using USGS Json earthquake data. Use the layers to filter between all earthquakes and only major earthquakes (above magnitude 5). Additionally, there is a tectonic plates layer that may be toggled off and on to view fault lines.
